Pivotal Tracker Mode provides a mode and functions for interacting with Pivotal Tracker through its API.
It is designed to give most of the functionality that is important to a developer.
It is not an attempt to replace every feature of the web interface.

## Installation

You can install via [marmalade](http://marmalade-repo.org/packages/pivotal-tracker)
or [melpa](http://melpa.milkbox.net/), or by cloning the repo.

## Initial Setup

Before using the tracker you must customize your pivotal API key.
You can obtain the key from the 'My Profile' link in the Pivotal Tracker
